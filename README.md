## NomWheels
-----

NomWheels is an application meant to aid users in finding establishments based on foods or cuisine they are craving. Users search for the cuisine/ food they are interesting in and can choose an establishment based on the photos of the cuisine associated with the establishment. This eliminates bias from misleading reviews and users can choose to visit these establishments based on photos from real customers. 

Users use the mouse or left and right arrow keys to view photos. They can hover and click on the image if they are interested in the establishment.
